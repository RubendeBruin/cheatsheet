Have a look at FURY: https://fury.gl/latest/index.html

they have some examples on how to use VTK and shaders.
Some of them work.


A typical shader looks like:
```

declarations 

main {
  implementation
}

```

VTK has methods to make modifications to the two sections independantly. The modifications are then combined/mixed with the shader code produced by VTK itself.

It is also possible to blindly override the full shader code, but then things like actor picking do not work anymore.

A full output of the compiled shader can be generated by inserting a small bug in the shader code. The full code will then be printed to the error console.
