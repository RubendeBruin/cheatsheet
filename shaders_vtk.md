Have a look at FURY: https://fury.gl/latest/index.html

they have some examples on how to use VTK and shaders.
Some of them work.


A typical shader looks like:
```

declarations 

main {
  implementation
}

```

VTK has methods to make modifications to the two sections independantly. The modifications are then combined/mixed with the shader code produced by VTK itself.

It is also possible to blindly override the full shader code, but then things like actor picking do not work anymore.

A full output of the compiled shader can be generated by inserting a small bug in the shader code. The full code will then be printed to the error console.

The standard shaders are: https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/tree/master/Rendering/OpenGL2/glsl
vtkPolyDataFS.glsl

and documentation is here: https://vtk.org/Wiki/Shaders_In_VTK

And for shaders see: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Shaders


Vertex shader:
```
in vec4 vertexMC;

// frag position in VC
out vec4 vertexVCVSOutput;
out vec4 vertexColorVSOutput;
```


so adding: 
`vertexColorVSOutput = vec4(0,0,0,1); `

to the vertex inplementation code makes all vertices black.

and 

`vertexColorVSOutput = vec4(vertexMC.x,vertexMC.y,vertexMC.z,1);`

will use the x-coodinate in ModelCoordinates as red-component


fragOutput0


Shaders summary:

- in  : input for shader
- out : output for shader
- uniform : globals

out of vertex will be linked to in of fragment if they have the same name and type

Example:
```
vertex_dec = \
    """
    out vec4 my_color;
    """

vertex_impl = \
    """
    my_color = vec4(vertexMC.x,vertexMC.y,vertexMC.z,1);
    """

fragment_dec = \
    """
    in vec4 my_color;
    """

fragment_impl = \
    """
    fragOutput0 = my_color;
    """

shader_to_actor(box_actor, "vertex", impl_code=vertex_impl,
                decl_code=vertex_dec, debug=False)

shader_to_actor(box_actor, "fragment", block="light", impl_code=fragment_impl,
                decl_code=fragment_dec, debug = False)
```


So what about outlines?
